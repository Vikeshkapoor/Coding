        Hi! My name is <b>Bubba</b> and I live in <b><u><span style="color:red">Red</span><span style="color: blue;">neck</span><span style="color: green;">ville</span></u></b>
    </p><br>
    <h2>Redneckville</h2>
    <p>I am very proud to be a resident of <u>Redneckville.</u><br>
        It is the best place to live if you are a redneck and you are dentally challenged
        (that is , your teeth are really bad like mine). Here's what I like about the place.

        <ul type="square">
            <li>It's in the middle of nowhere</li>
            <li>You don't have to brush your <b style="color:gold;">TEETH</b></li>
            <li>You can always marry a close relative</li>

        </ul>

    </p>
